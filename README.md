# Instabilities blog:
### Authors: Pratik Aghor and Adhithya Sivakumar 

* The blog is to solve and type-down selected problems from the classic text - 'Hydrodynamic Stability' by Drazin and Ried.
* The solutions are available at the back of the text, but the point is to try to do them and go beyond them.
* The principal goals of this endeavor are no short of ambitious:
1. To be able to **do** linear and non-linear stability calculations. 
2. To develop intuition about various classical fluid stability problems.
3. To solve the derived equations using analytical (asymptotics and perturbation methods) and/or numerical methods (spectral methods, shooting, Newton iterations, etc.) and to compare the results with the known literature. 
4. To write Dedalus scripts for the solved problems in the text as well.
