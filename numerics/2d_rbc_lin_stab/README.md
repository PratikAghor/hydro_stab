### 09/27/2023: 2d Rayleigh-Benard linear stability code:

* In dedalus2 env: ```bash rb_sigma_vs_k_runs.sh``` to obtain dispersion curves.
* In dedalus2 env: ```bash rb_neutral_stab_runs.sh``` to obtain neutral stability curves.
* Tested critical $Ra_{Tc} = 1708, k_c = 3.117$.
* Ran two neutral stab calculations, $Pr = 1, 1000$ to make sure $Ra_{Tc}$ is still 1708 and is independent of the fluid.
